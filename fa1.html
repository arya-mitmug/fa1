	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>My day starts as my 6 A.M alarm goes off, and I face one of the most challenging parts of the day, getting up. I freshen up, change into comfortable pambahay, and take a quick meal. Then, I go to my house office and officially start the day by going through some emails and finishing tasks. Reply to clients, arrange my schedule, review a few documents. By 9:30, I start preparing to head out to my next destination, freshen up once again and put on a cute work outfit.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>The next part of the day is either work in the firm office or a site visit. Most days are spent in the form, first, I settle in my personal office room and review the things I need to do for the day. I attend meetings with clients, discuss future projects, and go through even more emails. For lunch, I usually eat with some co-workers in the office lunchroom, or maybe take myself out to the restaurants nearby. Lunch is never quiet with my fellow architects, interior designers, and engineers. I return to my office and start the afternoon tasks, like reviewing elevations and blueprints, or making 3D models for projects online. On site visit days, I head out to ongoing project locations to check on the progress and make sure everything aligns with the plans. I meet with contractors and site engineers to discuss updates or adjustments that need to be made. Walking through the site gives me a clearer perspective of how the designs come to life beyond the screen.</p>

	      <p>Sanjay Puri’s story is one of passion, creativity, and perseverance that began with a simple love for drawing and design. From a young age, he was fascinated by the way spaces could influence how people feel and interact. That curiosity led him to a book which inspired him to start working at an architecture firm at 18. Pursuing architecture allowed him use his artistic vision to change how the people around him lives. At just 23, he started his own firm that came with many challenges, from gaining clients’ trust to managing complex projects. Despite the struggles, he continued experimenting with bold forms, vibrant colors, and designs that reflected the culture and climate of India. His journey shows that architecture is more than building structure, it’s about creating meaningful spaces that inspire others and tell stories through design.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>This story is not just about one person, but about all architects who have shaped and continue to shape the world around us. Sanjay Puri once said that architecture is art that breathes and changes people’s lives. It is through the vision and dedication of architects that we experience this living art within the spaces where we live, eat, heal, learn, and experience irreplaceable memories. Their work reminds us that architecture is not only about structures, but about the emotions, connections, and stories that unfold within them. And that is what makes architecture my dream job.</p>
